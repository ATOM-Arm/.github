## 🔍 Project Overview

The **ATOM Project** aims to develop a functional robotic arm using 3D printing technology and controlled through computer vision. The project is **inspired by the open-source [InMoov Project](http://www.inmoov.fr/)**, created by Gaël Langevin, and adapts its components to serve academic and experimental goals.

Designed and led by Computer Science student **Enzo R. L. D. Ribas**, this project integrates knowledge across mechanics, electronics, and software engineering. It offers a hands-on learning experience while fostering innovation in automation and assistive technology.

The robotic arm prototype is operated via a camera system, which interprets visual cues using artificial intelligence. These inputs are then translated into precise movements controlled by servo motors. The system uses:

- **OpenCV** for computer vision and gesture tracking  
- **Arduino** for servo motor control  
- **3D-printed parts** based on STL files, adapted from InMoov's modular designs  

The project serves as a foundation for further academic research and has the potential to evolve into assistive technologies or smart automation tools.
